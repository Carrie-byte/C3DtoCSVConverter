.c3d files contain motion data sensed and generated from the motion capture systems like Vicon or Phasespace, used for scientific or medical research. Extracting information from such file types can be quite painful as the data is not available straightforward, to be used in MATLAB or other programming languages, to process or visualize the data. This tool converts data from the .c3d file format into .csv file with every marker data available in the same row. Subsequent rows contain data from the next time frames.  

How to use : simply copy your .c3d file into dist/main/  and run the main.exe file. A prompt will ask the user for .c3d and .csv file names and the software will do the conversion. Your newly generated .csv file will appear in the same directory as main.exe . 

Thank You
